        :bdg-info-line:`Scientific context`

        Ocean warming is crucial to study because it disrupts marine ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and threatening species like coral reefs that are highly sensitive to temperature changes. Additionally, warmer oceans contribute to sea-level rise and amplify extreme weather events, impacting coastal communities and global climate patterns.

        :bdg-success-line:`Argo`

        A new generation of Argo floats called Deep Argo is now sampling the full ocean volume to provide a quantitative description of the changing state of the deep ocean and the patterns of ocean climate variability from months to decades.

        :bdg-danger-line:`Challenge`

        Participants should submit a Python code to determine the highest valid ocean temperature ever recorded with an Argo float between 3000 and 4000db.

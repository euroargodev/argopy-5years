        :bdg-info-line:`Scientific context`

        Ocean acidification is a key research topic because it disrupts the ability of marine organisms like corals, shellfish, and plankton to form shells and skeletons, which threatens marine biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Additionally, it affects global food security, as many human communities rely on marine species that are vulnerable to changing ocean chemistry.

        :bdg-success-line:`Argo`

        Since ocean pH is a dynamic variable that changes on daily, seasonal, interannual, and decadal time scales, it is a perfect fit for the Argo network !

        :bdg-danger-line:`Challenge`

        Participants should propose a Python code to determine what is the highest pH ever recorded

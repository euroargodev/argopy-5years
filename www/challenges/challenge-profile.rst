        :bdg-info-line:`Context`

        The global Argo array is made up of thousands of floats. Each float may have its own technology and sensors manufacturer. But the international Argo Data Management Team homogenizes and enforces strict file content and format conventions that are collectively decided. The Argo database is an example for many ocean observing systems.

        :bdg-success-line:`Argo`

        Implementing the ambitious OneArgo design will require funding but also a huge community effort to keep the database standards at the highest requirement levels.

        :bdg-danger-line:`Challenge`

        Participants should propose a Python code to determine which float reported the 3.000.000th Argo profile of the dataset in 2024.

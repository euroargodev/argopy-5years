        :bdg-info-line:`Scientific context`

        Concentrations of dissolved oxygen are decreasing in many areas of the ocean interior and oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) may be expanding. Declining oxygen levels threaten marine life, particularly species that cannot survive in low-oxygen environments, leading to biodiversity loss and habitat shrinkage.

        :bdg-success-line:`Argo`

        Dissolved oxygen concentration is both of biogeochemical and physical oceanographic interest and is the oldest parameter measured by Argo floats after the CTD.

        :bdg-danger-line:`Challenge`

        Participants should propose a Python code to determine what is the largest oxygen concentration **anomaly** ever recorded in one of the OMZ.

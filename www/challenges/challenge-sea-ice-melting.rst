        :bdg-info-line:`Scientific Context`

        Sea-ice melting accelerates sea-level rise, which threatens coastal regions and infrastructure worldwide. Melting sea-ice also reduces the Earth's albedo (reflectivity), intensifying global warming and disrupting climate patterns, with profound impacts on ecosystems and weather systems.

        :bdg-success-line:`Argo`

        Argo floats are able to navigate below the sea-ice and to avoid reaching the surface when ice is detected, preventing sensor damages. Data are stored onboard, and floats continue to cycle as usual up to to point when reaching an ice-free surface.

        :bdg-danger-line:`Challenge`

        Participants should propose a Python code to determine which Argo float stayed trapped under sea ice for the longest period before sending correct data.

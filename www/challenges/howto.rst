.. admonition:: How to participate ?

    The deadline to submit you response to a challenge is **January 31st, midnight (CET)**

    Send a `gist link <https://gist.github.com/>`_ or a zipped notebook to: **argopy (at) proton.me**

.. topic:: What's expected ?

    - A python jupyter notebook providing answer to the challenge
    - A documented script (provide information for code that would not be self-explanatory)
    - That an **argopy** feature must be used at least once in the procedure
    - That the computation be reproducible (e.g. avoid to use unpublished dataset, reference used data, etc...)
    - That the computation could be ran on a laptop

.. hint::

    Responses will be evaluated by the argopy development team along the following criteria:

    - Documentation quality
    - Script readability
    - Amount of data downloaded (the smaller the better)

    The most *elegant* responses will be added to the `argopy documentation gallery <https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html>`_.

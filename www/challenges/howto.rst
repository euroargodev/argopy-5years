.. admonition:: How to participate ?

    The deadline to submit you response to a challenge is **January 31st, midnight (CET)**

    Send a `gist link <https://gist.github.com/>`_ or a zipped notebook to: **argopy (at) proton.me**

.. topic:: What's expected ?

    A python jupyter notebook providing answer to the challenge and that:

    - is documented (provide information for parts that would not be self-explanatory),
    - uses at least once in the procedure an **argopy** feature,
    - provides a reproducible computation (e.g. avoid to use unpublished dataset, reference used data, etc...),
    - provides a computation executable on a laptop.

.. hint::

    Responses will be evaluated by the argopy team along the following criteria:

    - Documentation quality
    - Script readability
    - Amount of data downloaded (the smaller the better)

    The most *elegant* responses will be added to the `argopy documentation gallery <https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html>`_.

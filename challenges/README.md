# 🏆argopy challenges

The idea is to propose coding challenges to the community, rewards are to be determined.

Possible challenges:
- Determine the Argo highest temperature ever recorded
- Determine the lowest oxygen concentration ever recorded
- Determine the lowest pH ever recorded
- Determine the highest chlorophyl concentration ever recorded
- etc ...

Each of the challenges should be used to highlight a climate change impact on the ocean

# üèÜargopy challenges

The idea is to propose coding challenges to the community, rewards, if any, are to be determined.

**Coding challenge**: We propose something to compute with Argo data or floats, participants submit a Jupyter Notebook as a solution.

**Evaluation**: Solutions should be elegant, accurate and using argopy somewhere in the analysis. Subjective !

**Implementation**: We imagine a single webpage with an large infographic to illustrate environmental/climate-change issues related to each coding challenges, and addressed by OneArgo. Clicking on one topic/challenge opens a pop up indicating how to submit a challenge answer (e.g. by email, an url to a repo/gist notebook etc)

**List of challenges**:

- Raising ocean temperature. Challenge: Determine the Argo highest temperature ever recorded
- Deoxygenation. Challenge: Determine the lowest oxygen concentration ever recorded
- Acidification. Challenge: Determine the lowest pH ever recorded
- Changing polar ocean. Challenge: Determine which float stayed trapped under ice the longest
- Missing data. Challenge: Determine which float reported the 3.000.000th Argo profile of the dataset
